				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p> I am a currently a senior, expected to receive my degree this year. My major is 
					Information Technology with a specialization in Web Applications. I currently hold a high 
					GPA and hope to work hard enough to retain it. I currently work in my industry and plan on
					growing into a bigger role at my company in either networking, development, management, or a combination 
					of all. I work full time as well as attend NJIT full time (18 credits).
					</p>
					
					<p> I have 2 sons, a 6 year old and a 4 month old. I enjoy leading volunteer initiatives as a project coordinator for Jersey Cares. I enjoy practicing Kimura Shukokai Karate. I am
						a video game geek. I play both PC and Xbox1 games (gamertag: gangsta pancake). I love to kayak, hike, fish, camp, workout, swim. I love boating,
						have my boat license, and hope to purchase a boat this Sprng. I enjoy shooting at the gun range. I love cars. #subaruwrx </p>

								Gases, thermochemistry, quantum

						issues and problems central to the rise of Hitler and the Nazi state: a perennially fascinating
